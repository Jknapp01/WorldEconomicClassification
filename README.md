# World Economic Classification

I came across this interesting [World Economic Classifications](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanetteponder/world-economic-classifications) dataset and wanted to explore what features might correlate most with wealth rank. Some information about this dataset follows:

*This UN and IMF-sourced dataset was created as an easy-to-use and versatile source for many types of projects - social justice, economics, public policy, education, and more. When I posted my notebook about class inequality and university choice, I looked high and low for an economic classification dataset that I could merge with my base data, but couldn't find one - not even in the U.N. dataset collection. I made this to fill that need, and I hope it helps you out.

All data is sourced from the most recent info and numbers I could find from highly reputable sources. I'll definitely update it when new info comes available, so bookmark this and watch for updates.*

Thankyou to Jeanette Ponder for assembling this dataset. 

In addition to determining what features are most important in determining wealth rank, as a Canadian I wanted to know where Canada fits into these statistics, and what features would cause our wealth rank to increase or decrease. 

**Some information about the dataset features follows:**

The World Economic Classifications dataset is organized into nine columns:

1. country_name - Country name as commonly known. When applicable, any variations appear in parentheses after the most common name.
2. un_class_2014 - Classifications from the Development Policy and Analysis Division (DPAD) of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (UN/DESA), 2014. It describes basic economic conditions and is based on World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) data.
3. imf_class_2023 - Classifications from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s April 2023 report, "World Economic Outlook Database: Groups and Aggregates Information."
4. g7 - Denotes countries that are part of the United Nations Gang of 7, or G7, and are ranked as Major World Economies by the IMF.
5. eu_member - Member states of the European Union, both established and new.
6. fuel_exp_country - Fuel exporter country. According to DPAD, "An economy is classified as a fuel exporter if the share of fuel exports in its total merchandise exports is greater than 20 per cent and the level of fuel exports is at least 20 per cent higher than that of the countryâ€™s fuel imports. This criterion is drawn from the share of fuel exports in the total value of world merchandise trade."
7. wealth_rank - Wealth ranking according to gross domestic product (GDP) at Purchasing Power Parity, or PPP. Worldometer states, "PPP takes into account the relative cost of living, rather than using only exchange rates, therefore providing a more accurate picture of the real differences in income."
8. gdp_ppp_2022 - Per capita GDP at PPP as of 2022.
9. gdp_pc_2022 - Per capita GDP as of 2022.
